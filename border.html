>To center an image, you can use the following HTML and CSS code:

HTML:

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Centered Image" class="centered-image">
```

style
.centered-image {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

This will center the image horizontally. If you want to center it vertically as well, you can use:

CSS:

```
.centered-image {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

This will center the image both horizontally and vertically.

Alternatively, you can use flexbox to center the image:

HTML:

```
<div class="centered-image-container">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Centered Image">
</div>
```

CSS:

```
.centered-image-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh; /* optional */
}
```

This will center the image both horizontally and vertically within the container.
```

This code uses flexbox to center the table horizontally on the page. The `justify-content: center` property centers the table along the main axis (horizontally in this case).

You can also add `align-items: center` to center the table vertically:

```
```

This code sets the `height` of the `body` element to `100vh` (100% of the viewport height) and uses `align-items: center` to center the table vertically.

Add this code to  HTML file, and the table should appear centered on the web page.
